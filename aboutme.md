title: About me
subtitle: Call me Hurd, just Hurd.
---

I have worked as a Unix system developer at IT companies for a long time.    
My main programming languages are C, C++, and Python,    
and I am also interested in Objective-C and Swift.    
I prefer emacs over vi.    
My name is Charlie Choe, but if youâ€™d like to be my friend,    
please call me Hurd, just Hurd.
